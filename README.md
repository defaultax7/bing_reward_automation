# bing_reward_automation

Simple and shitty bing daily search bot for personal use.
It is written on C++ using windows API to simulate real user Input instead of using selenium.
The code itself is very shitty, even the array size is hardcode. However, it works so it doesn't bother me.

This is mainly for Chrome, but it seem to be also work in Edge.

Before you use it, you need to set the default search engine to bing and be sure you have already loggined in your xbox account for the rewards.
Also, this program assume you did not open dev tool and in dev tool mobile view is not enabled.

To use it, just double click the exe and open the brower.
After both are opened, click an empty space in the browser and type enter.
